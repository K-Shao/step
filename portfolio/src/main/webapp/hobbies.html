      <p>In my free time, I really enjoy playing games of all sorts. I like the mental competition, 
         as things rarely get boring when you're trying to outsmart someone who's trying to outsmart
         you. My favorites include: 
        <ul>
          <li>Chess
            <ul>
              <li>There are a ton of variants of chess, too!</li>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegspiel_(chess)">Kreigspiel</a>: imperfect information chess</li>
              <li>Three check: you win once you give check three times</li>
              <li>Atomic: captured pieces "explode"</li>
              <li>...and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants">many more</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Poker</li>
          <li>Social deception games</li>
          <li>Monopoly (for some reason)</li>
        </ul>
