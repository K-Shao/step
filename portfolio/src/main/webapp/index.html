      <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
            <p> My name is Kevin Shao, and this is my portfolio! I live in Los Angeles, California, 
                but I went to a boarding school in New Jersey for high school and then ended up 
                at MIT, where I just finished my first year.</p>

            <p> In high school, I had the chance to try several sports, two of which have played 
                a pretty big part in who I am: swimming and rowing.</p>

            <p> In terms of programming, I love building everything, but I especially love games. 
                One of my first big projects was a game of Chess, and some of my later projects have 
                followed in a similar vein. I'm also really curious about Machine Learning, despite
                not having any formal instruction in it, and I'm always ready to learn! For some of
                my prouder projects, check out my <a href='http://github.com/K-Shao'>Github</a>! </p>

            <p> In my free time, I really enjoy playing games of all sorts. I like the mental competition, 
                as things rarely get boring when you're trying to outsmart someone who's trying to outsmart
                you. My favorites include: 

                <ul>
                    <li>Chess</li>
                    <li>Poker</li>
                    <li>Social deception games</li>
                    <li>Monopoly (for some reason)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
