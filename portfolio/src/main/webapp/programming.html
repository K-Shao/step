    <p>In terms of programming, I love building everything, but I especially love games. 
       One of my first big projects was a game of Chess, and some of my later projects have 
       followed in a similar vein. I'm also really curious about Machine Learning, despite
       not having any formal instruction in it, and I'm always ready to learn! For some of
       my prouder projects, check out my <a href="http://github.com/K-Shao">Github</a>! </p>
